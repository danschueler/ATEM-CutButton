# ATEM-CutButton
M5StickC Plus version of a Cut Button for Blackmagic Design ATEM switchers

This code works on an M5StickC Plus board using Arduino ide.  It relies on code from Kasper Skarhoj, a library he published a few years ago.  
It should work on any ATEM, but is currently configured to switch only 4 cameras, as on an ATEM Mini, ATEM Mini Pro or ATEM Mini Pro ISO.
It was derived from code from onguyoneblog.com, but has been extensively modified, including display changes and added button support.
It should work on the original M5StickC, but would need changes to the label display code.
